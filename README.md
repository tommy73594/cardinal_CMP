# cardinal_CMP
Cardinal NIC and Chip Multiprocessor. Project from EE577b-VLSI System Design  

•	Designed a 4-node Cardinal Chip Multiprocessor including Network Interface (NIC), Ring topology Network on Chip, Router, and 4-stage pipelined CPU to process and communicate data packet concurrently in each node in a team of 2.  
•	Resolved data dependency by applying internal forwarding register file, hazard data unit, and forward unit in CPU, decreased power consumption by 20% with clock-gating.  
•	Ran Synthesis and mitigated critical path to improve clock period by 40%, static timing analysis to ensure no timing violation, place and route to generate the final core of area 1800 x 1800 (nm^2).
